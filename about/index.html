            <b>Program introduction</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            We invite all computer vision researchers in the LatinX in AI community to mentor Google Explore CSR mentees for individual research projects.
            </p>

            <p>
            To apply as a mentor, you should submit a one-page research project, describing the purpose of the project, the skills to be learned during the internship and the expected skills the mentee should have as a minimum to apply. You can provide references (i.e., articles, links to Github repositories) and any additional information you consider relevant.
            </p>

            <p>
            Your students will work on a project for 6 months. For 2024, the dates are January 6th - July 6th (tentatively). At the conclusion of this internship, participants are expected to write a workshop/conference article and present it to their peers in a joint virtual seminar. We expect that best research articles will be submitted at LatinX in AI workshops through 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
            This mentorship is intended to take students through an abbreviated process of scientific research. Students who have completed an internship typically emerge with a renewed dedication to the pursuit of a scientific career, along with a deeper appreciation for research. Also, mentees can gather advice from their mentors on how to apply to graduate programs, how to write good research articles, how to expand their academic research network, and others.
            </p>

            <b>Goals of the program</b>
            <p>
            The goal of our program is to encourage students at the LatinX undergraduate/master level, to pursue Computer Science research and apply to graduate programs.

            <b>Program introduction</b>
            <p> 
            Research in Computer Science  has broad implications for billions of people, and we aim to represent the experiences, perspectives, concerns and creative enthusiasm of all the people around the world. The LATAM Undergraduate/Master Research Program supports the pursuit of computing research for students from historically marginalized groups through career mentorship, peer-to-peer networking, and building awareness about pathways within the field. Our program strives to cultivate the spirit of inquiry in students who are interested in AI and Computer Vision, by providing them with opportunities for interaction with renowned scientists and to perform scientific investigations in international research laboratories.
            </p>  
            <p> 
            The transition from university to a career in computer science and Artificial Intelligence can be difficult and quite often a daunting prospect. This initiative seeks to assist students from LATAM in this transition, and mentorship is a great first step. Our mentoring scheme aims to encourage and support students with an interest in pursuing a career in  Computer Vision and apply to graduate programs in the future.  
            </p>   
            <b>Goals of the program</b>
            <p> 
            The aim of the program is to help students hone research skills in computer science, artificial intelligence and more specifically, in computer vision via our mentoring program. in which undergraduate/master students are matched with a  mentor and potentially a small group of peers who are at a similar academic stage, and interested in the same research area. The mentoring program will be centered on discussing and identifying opportunities around several topics, supported by the mentor through one-on-one meetings:
            </p> 
            <ul>
            <li>Introduction to research pathways
            <li>Defining a research problem
            <li>Working on this research problem for a 6 month period
            <li>Navigating the publication process and submitting a paper
            <li>Applying to graduate school
            </ul>
            <p> 
            In addition, students will join the broader LatinX in Computer Vision (LXCV) peer community, and will be invited to virtual networking events, career panels, tech talks, and information sessions about computing research opportunities. 
            </p> 
            <b>How does the program work?</b>
            <p> 
            Mentors are expected to submit a one pager describing their project and the expectations in terms of skills and previous knowledge, including scientific bibliography. Then, we will match mentors with mentees (students/participants), based on their expressed interests. We encourage mentors  and mentees to meet weekly during the spring semester, to encourage, and advise them on their agreed research projects. 
            </p>  
            <b>Target audience</b>
